Rigid Bodies

Some quick notes about physical properties of rigid bodies. Make sure
you feel comfortable with the geometry of $SE(3)$ first, otherwise
have a look [[../math/group/se3.org][here]].

* TODO Configuration Space
  
* Inertia Tensor
  
  The kinetic energy of a solid, rigid or not, is the (continuous) sum
  of the kinetic energies of each of its particles, where a /mass
  density/ function $\rho(x)$ is used to indicate the mass of each
  point of the object. In other words:
  
  \begin{align}
  T(\omega, v) &= \int_O \rho(x) \half \norm{v + \omega \times x}^2 \dd x \\
  &= 
  \half \norm{v}^2 \int_O \rho(x) \dd x \quad -
  \quad v^T \block{\int_O \rho(x) \hat{x} \dd x} \omega \quad +
  \quad \half \omega^T \block{\int_O \rho(x) \hat{x}^T\hat{x} \dd x} \omega \\
  &= 
  \half m \norm{v} \quad + \quad m v^T c \times \omega \quad + \quad \half \omega^T I \omega
  \end{align}

  where $\rho(x)$ is the mass density function, its integral $m$ is
  the total mass of the object, $\mathcal{I}$ is the (rotational) body-fixed
  inertia tensor, defined as:
  
  \[ \mathcal{I} = \int_O \rho(x) \hat{x}^T \hat{x} \dd x \]
  
  and $c$ is the center of gravity in body coordinates:
  
  \[ c = \frac{1}{m} \int_O \rho(x) x \dd x \]
  
  If we set the body coordinate frame at the center of gravity, the
  expression above conveniently simplifies to:
  
  \[ T(\omega, v) = \half m \norm{v}^2 + \half \omega^T \mathcal{I} \omega \]
  
  The above gives a definition of the rigid body-fixed inertia tensor
  as:
  
  \[ M = \mat{\mathcal{I} & 0\\ 0 & m} \]
  
  so that:
  
  \[T(\omega, v) = \half (\omega, v)^T M (\omega, v) \]
