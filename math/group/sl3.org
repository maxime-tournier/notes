Some notes on the (3-dimensional) special linear group (especially for
computing exponential/logarithm)

* Definition

  This is the subgroup of invertible matrices with unit determinant:

  \[ SL_n(\RR) = { g \in GL_n(\RR), \quad \det(g) = 1} \]
  

* Polar Decomposition
  
  Any invertible matrix $g \in GL_n(\RR)$ can be /uniquely/ decomposed
  as:
  
  \[ g = q p, \quad q \in SO_n(\RR), \quad p \in \Sym^{++}_n(\RR) \]
  
  Thus, any unit determinant matrix can be expressed as above with:

  \[ g = q p, \quad \det(p) = 1 \]
  
** Eigen decomposition of $p$

   $p$ being real positive definite, it can itself be uniquely
   decomposed as:

   \[ p = u \lambda \inv{u}, \quad u \in SO_n(\RR) \]
   
   where $\lambda$ is diagonal with unit determinant, /i.e/ $\prod
   \lambda_i = 1$.

   Finally, merging $q$ and $u$, we see that any $g \in SL_n(\RR)$ can
   be decomposed as:

   \[ g = u \lambda \inv{v}, \quad u, v \in SO_n(\RR), \quad det(\lambda) = 1 \]

   
* Lie Group 

  We use the above decomposition to compute the exponential and
  logarithm in $SL_n(\RR)$. For this we use the SLERP interpolation of
  $u$ and $v$, where the logarithm/exponential are easy[1] to compute:

  \[ k = u.\exp\block{0.5 \block{ \log \block{\inv{u} v }}} \]
  
  Noting that:

  \[ k = v \exp\block{0.5 \block{ \log \block{\inv{v} u }}} \]

  It is easy to verify that:
  
  \[ \block{ \inv{k} u } \block{ \inv{k} v } = 1 \quad (1) \]
  
  The idea now is to work on $\inv{k} g k$ on which the logarithm is
  easily computed as we show below.
  
** Eigendecomposition 

   Let us express $h = \inv{k} g k$:

   \begin{align}
   h &= \inv{k} g k \\
     &= \inv{k} u \lambda \inv{v} k \\
     &= \block{\inv{k} u} \lambda \inv{ \block{ \inv{k} v }} \\
     AAARGH

     \end{align}
